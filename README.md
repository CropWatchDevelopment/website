# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Google reCAPTCHA setup

The contact form uses the Google reCAPTCHA checkbox widget. Provide your public site key through a `.env` entry so the widget can render during build and runtime:

```
PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
```

The matching secret key should be stored on the server-side handler that validates form submissions before processing them.
