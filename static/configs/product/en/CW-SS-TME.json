    "description": "The CropWatch® Soil Sensor Series is designed to provide the greatest level of connectivity possible. We have focused on sensor ruggedness to operate in the harshest environments as well as having a long battery life this sensor is ment to be set and left to work for years. We have also worked with farmers to determine the optimal sensors and aim to provide the best possible accuracy and reliability outside of a lab setting.",
