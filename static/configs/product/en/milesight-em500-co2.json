    "description": "The EM500-CO2 is designed for monitoring CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure in outdoor scenarios. More than just a carbon dioxide sensor, it features 4 sensors in 1 and measures CO2 levels from 400 ppm to 5,000 ppm. With an ultra-rugged enclosure and an IP65 rating, it is built to withstand harsh environments. The device offers LoRaWAN速 wireless deployment with low power consumption, long-lasting battery life of up to 10 years, and easy configuration via NFC. It is ideal for applications such as greenhouses, building ventilation, wine cellars, and forest fire detection.",
