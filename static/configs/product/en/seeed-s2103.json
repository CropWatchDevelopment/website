    "description": "SenseCAP S2103 is a robust CO2 sensor designed for outdoor and harsh environments. Compatible with worldwide LoRaWAN® networks, it offers an ultra-wide transmission range of up to 2 km in urban settings and 10 km in line-of-sight scenarios. Powered by a standard D-size SOCl2 battery (type: ER34615) with up to 10 years of battery life, it features an IP66-rated enclosure and an operating temperature range from -40℃ to +85℃. With simple no-code configuration via the SenseCAP Mate App and a series of rigorous reliability tests ensuring high performance under extreme conditions, the S2103 is engineered for demanding applications.",
