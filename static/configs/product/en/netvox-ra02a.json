    "description": "RA02A is a smoke detection alarm featuring a built-in photoelectric smoke detector and buzzer. It detects smoke density in the environment and sounds an alarm when the density exceeds a preset threshold. In addition, the alarm data can be transmitted to other devices for display. RA02A utilizes the SX1276 wireless communication module for LoRaWAN™ Class A connectivity.",
