    "description": "The CropWatch® Soil Sensor Series is designed to provide the greatest level of connectivity possible. Soil PH can be increabibly challenging to get with a sensor that is burried in the ground. We have worked with real farmers all over Miyazaki Japan to find the optimal sensor to provide reliable accurate data that is the closest to labratory tests as possible while still being able to be burried in the ground for years.",
